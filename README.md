# find_my_net
A small utility app to find a point with good network connection in areas where network coverage is very bad.

In case of disasters, one of the things that would help a lot is mobile network signal. Which is mostly broken in case of floods, landslides, cyclones, etc. Pretty much any big disaster.

Our android app aims to provide a low-power consuming, background app, that keeps monitoring the mobile network signal, and alerts the user, if it has peaked in quite a while.

Another trouble while grasping for network signal is the amount of displacement one has to make to get proper signal. That is, when someone is looking out for best signal, he/she has to take the device to numerous locations to get the best result.

We aim to simplify this by a feature in the app, that allows multiple people to check for signal all at once, and compare the signals received by all the devices, possibly in real time, and finding the best result from that. The time required and area to be covered for searching for signal is greatly reduced with each new user/device added to the search. We beleive this will greatly help users during stressful times.

Also, apart from disasters, this app also finds general use cases, for places where network availability is not. Taking my own example, there are a lot of places in our campus, where the network availability varies greatly, even if you move your device by a small distance. This app my just help you find your best bench in a classroom, best location in your hostel to talk to your loved ones (I had to do this manually), etc.

Technologies to be used :
Android (Of course)
Bluetooth/WiFi : to connect multiple devices for real time comparison of network signals.
